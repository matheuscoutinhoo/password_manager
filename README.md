# Password Manager

## This project works as follows:
- You can create a new, random password with a designation (email, bank account, etc). When this function is executed, a txt document going to be created in the folder of the project (the other passwords will be entered in this same document, unless you delete it).

- You can see your saved passwords in the txt document or by the program.

- You can clean the document if you want with the program.

- And, also, you can send the txt document to your email (for this, remember that you are using the outlook server and that you need to put your account details and of the recipient).

For second and third options, you gonna need to input the password "M4STER001" (You can change this in the code if you want).
