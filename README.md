# Password Manager:

## This project works as follows:
- You can create a new, random password with a designation (email, bank account, etc). When this function is executed, a txt document will be created in the folder (in this document the other passwords will be entered).

- You can see your saved passwords in the txt document.

- You also can clean the document if you want.

For these last two options, you gonna need to input the password "M4STER001" (You can change this in the code if you want).
